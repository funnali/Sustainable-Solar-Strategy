  ### Project Overview
  This data analysis project aims to provide insite into operational efficiency and sustainability of the MoonLight Energy Solutions by identifying key trends and insights to support data-driven recommendations, particularly in identifying high-potential regions for solar installation aligned with long-term sustainability goals. Key deliverables include a strategy report providing actionable insights to realize the overarching objectives of the company by analysing the solar farm data.
  ### Data Sources
  solar farm data : The primary data set used for this analysis is is "solar radiation measurment.csv"file,containing detailed information on solar farm data found in Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo.

### Tools Used
- Programming Language: [download here](https://chat.openai.com/)
Python serves as the primary programming language for its versatility and extensive support in the data science ecosystem.
- Interactive Computing Environment: 
Utilize Jupyter Notebooks, offering an interactive environment for seamless integration of code, visualization, and documentation.
- Data Manipulation Library:
Employ Pandas, a powerful Python library designed for efficient data manipulation and analysis of structured data.
- Scientific Computing Framework: 
NumPy provides essential support for array operations, mathematical functions, and numerical computations essential for data analysis.
- Data Visualization Tools:
  -Matplotlib: A versatile plotting library for generating static, interactive, and publication-quality visualizations in Python.
  -Seaborn: Building on Matplotlib, Seaborn offers an intuitive interface for creating informative and visually appealing statistical graphics.
- Web Application Development:
Leverage Streamlit, a Python library enabling rapid development of interactive web applications for data analysis and visualization.
- Version Control System:
Git serves as the cornerstone for managing source code changes, facilitating collaboration, and ensuring project integrity throughout development.
- Collaboration Platform: 
GitHub provides a centralized platform for hosting Git repositories, facilitating seamless collaboration, code review, and project management.
- Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE): 
Opt for a suitable text editor or IDE such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or JupyterLab for efficient code development and editing.
- Markup Language:
Markdown offers a lightweight yet versatile markup language for formatting plain text, facilitating the creation of project documentation, README files, and annotations within Jupyter Notebooks.
- Command Line Interface:
Utilize the terminal (Unix-based systems) or Command Prompt (Windows) for executing Git commands, navigating directories, and running Python scripts, ensuring smooth project workflow.
